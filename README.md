### Hey there!

I recently completed a 10 week bootcamp in Boston called Launch Academy that focuses on web development. I'll be working on projects I find interesting and putting them here as I learn more about the field of web development. At this point, I'd like to know more about: websockets, React Redux, and APIs, so look out for any repos where I'll play around with these!

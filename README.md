### Hey there!

I recently completed a 10 week bootcamp in Boston called Launch Academy that focuses on web development. Coming out of Launch, I have a small to-do list/task scheduler app that I want to keep working on, which you can find at https://github.com/vkk5252/bt-recurring-task-scheduler. I'll also be working on other projects I find interesting and putting them here as I learn more about the field of web development. At this point, I'd like to know more about: websockets, React Redux, and APIs, so look out for any repos where I play around with these!
